# ProcessWire Snippets

## This project will not receive any updates, because it is a lot of work to push updates to the snippets and then pack everything into a VSCode extension.

You can either use this extension as is ([see the old readme here](https://github.com/BernhardBaumrock/pwsnippets/tree/79a84fa42508bf1e5fcea21b36ac313c55af6995)) or [use the Snippets provided by RockMigrations](https://github.com/baumrock/RockMigrations#snippets).
